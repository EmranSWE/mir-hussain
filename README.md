I like to work as a front-end developer because it gives me a lot of flexibility to make something new and experiment with new technologies. I love to work with React and Sass.

Skills: HTML / CSS / JavaScript / React / Sass 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web browser extension. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UI/UX designing. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with fixing my coding addiction. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can make a F-15 jet out of A4 size paper.
